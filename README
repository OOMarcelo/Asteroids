This is a game I wrote back in February of 2010. I was bored and had two snow days to kill, so I ended up with this. That said, I wrote it in an incredibly quick time, and as a result, there are a ton of ugly, quickly hacked together pieces of this, which I haven't bothered to clean up, until now (hopefully).

The images are by Stephen Schwahn (http://thousandcodes.com/), and I'm extremely greatful he gave me permission to use them, since my first image was basically a terribly draw circle.

If, for some inexplicable reason, you feel that this code could help you, or you want to modify it, feel free! This will be licensed under the GNU GPLv3, at least for now. If I decide on another license in the future, I'll do my best to ensure that they are compatible and equally permissive. Check out LICENSE at the root of this project (or see http://www.gnu.org/licenses/gpl.txt)

That's it. Feel free to ridicule me (it'll force me into making it better!)
